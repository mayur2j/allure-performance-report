# Performance Report Enhancements

## Overview
The HTML performance report has been enhanced with clear pass/fail indicators, color coding, threshold information, and scenario-wise summaries.

## Key Features

### 1. Overall Pass/Fail Status
- **Large header banner** at the top showing overall test status
- **Green background** with ✅ for PASSED tests
- **Red background** with ❌ for FAILED tests
- Shows count of metrics that passed threshold requirements

### 2. Clear Thresholds
Each metric has three threshold levels:
- **Good (Passed)**: ✅ Green - Performance meets target
- **Acceptable (Warning)**: ⚡ Yellow - Performance acceptable but could be better
- **Poor (Failed)**: ❌ Red - Performance needs improvement

### 3. Performance Thresholds

| Metric | Good (Passed) | Acceptable (Warning) | Poor (Failed) |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Page Load Time | ≤ 2000 ms | 2001-3000 ms | > 3000 ms |
| DOM Ready Time | ≤ 1500 ms | 1501-2500 ms | > 2500 ms |
| Response Time | ≤ 800 ms | 801-1200 ms | > 1200 ms |
| TTFB | ≤ 400 ms | 401-600 ms | > 600 ms |
| Connection Time | ≤ 200 ms | 201-400 ms | > 400 ms |
| DNS Lookup Time | ≤ 100 ms | 101-200 ms | > 200 ms |

### 4. Color-Coded Metric Cards
Each performance metric is displayed in a card with:
- **Border and background color** matching the status (green/yellow/red)
- **Large emoji** indicator (✅/⚡/❌)
- **Status badge** showing PASSED/WARNING/FAILED
- **Threshold information** showing all three levels
- **Hover effects** for better interactivity

### 5. Scenario-wise Performance Summary
A detailed table showing:
- Performance breakdown for **each scenario**
- **All 6 metrics** per scenario with color-coded status
- **Overall scenario status** (PASSED/FAILED)
- Easy identification of problematic scenarios

### 6. Summary Statistics
Four key summary boxes displaying:
- Total Scenarios
- Total Steps
- Cache Hit Rate
- Metrics Passed (X/6)

## Overall Pass Criteria
The test suite is marked as **PASSED** if:
- At least **4 out of 6** metrics meet the "Good" threshold
- Otherwise marked as **FAILED**

Each scenario in the scenario-wise summary follows the same rule.

## Report Location
The enhanced report is generated at:
```
target/allure-results/suite-performance-summary.html
```

## Automatic Generation
The report is automatically generated via a shutdown hook when the test suite completes. No manual invocation is required.

## Visual Design
- **Modern, responsive design** with gradient backgrounds
- **Professional color scheme** using Bootstrap-inspired colors
- **Card-based layout** for metrics
- **Interactive hover effects**
- **Clear typography** with proper hierarchy

## Usage
Simply run your tests as usual. The detailed performance report will be automatically generated when the test suite completes. Open the HTML file in any web browser to view the comprehensive performance analysis.
